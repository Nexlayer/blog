The Model Context Protocol (MCP) represents the future of AI agent interactions. Nexlayer's MCP integration makes deployment completely invisible to both agents and users.

## Seamless Integration

Our MCP server connects directly to leading AI coding tools:

- **Cursor**: Deploy with a single command or automatically on save
- **Claude**: Ship applications directly from chat conversations
- **Windsurf**: Instant deployment from the editor interface
- **Custom Agents**: Full API access for any AI system

## How It Works

When an AI agent generates code, our MCP integration:

1. **Analyzes** the codebase structure and dependencies
2. **Provisions** appropriate cloud resources automatically
3. **Deploys** to our global edge network
4. **Monitors** performance and scales as needed

## Developer Experience

```bash

No setup required - just code

Agent generates app

MCP handles deployment automatically

Live URL ready in 60 seconds

```

## Production-Ready Features

Every deployment includes SSL certificates, CDN distribution, automatic scaling, and comprehensive monitoring - all configured automatically based on your application's needs.

The MCP standard eliminates the gap between AI code generation and production deployment.
