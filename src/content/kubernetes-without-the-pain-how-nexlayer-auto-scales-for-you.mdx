Kubernetes is powerful but complex. Nexlayer gives you all the benefits of container orchestration without any of the operational overhead.

## The Kubernetes Challenge

Traditional Kubernetes requires:
- Cluster management and maintenance
- YAML configuration files
- Resource planning and allocation
- Monitoring and logging setup
- Security policy configuration
- Networking and ingress management

## Nexlayer's Invisible Orchestration

Our platform runs a managed Kubernetes layer that:

- **Auto-scales** based on traffic patterns
- **Self-heals** failed containers automatically  
- **Optimizes** resource allocation in real-time
- **Secures** workloads with zero-trust networking
- **Monitors** performance with built-in observability

## Intelligent Scaling

Our AI analyzes your application to predict scaling needs:

- **Traffic Patterns**: Historical usage data
- **Code Complexity**: Resource requirements analysis
- **Geographic Distribution**: Edge deployment optimization
- **Cost Optimization**: Right-sizing for efficiency

## Enterprise Features

- **Multi-region deployment** across 15+ global locations
- **Automatic failover** with 99.99% uptime SLA
