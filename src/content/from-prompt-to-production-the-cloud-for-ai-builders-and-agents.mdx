## The AI Builder's Journey: From Prompt to Production
AI can already write code. But for most builders, thatâ€™s where the magic stops.  
Your repo sits in GitHub, your demo runs locally â€” and production feels impossible to reach.  
---

## 90% of AI App MVPs Die Here
AI builders can spin up demos at lightning speed.  
But shipping to production? Thatâ€™s where most projects die.  

**90% of AI App MVPs never reach real users.**
---
## The 70% Problem
AI coding agents can generate 70% of an app â€” boilerplate, CRUD, scaffolding.  
But the hard 30% is where momentum collapses:

- Debugging loops that never end  
- Scaling apps beyond toy workloads  
- Adding real security and compliance  
- Surviving real-world traffic  

Hereâ€™s the truth: if your app logic is broken, no platform can save it.  
But if your code runs locally, Nexlayer ensures it *actually ships* to production and scales.  
No infra walls. No DevOps detours. No surprise bills.  

ðŸ‘‰ With Nexlayer, working code wonâ€™t die in localhost.

## The Pain You Feel Every Day
- You vibe-code an MVP in Cursor or Claude Code â†’ it works great in a demo.
- You share screenshots and videos on X.com or Discord â†’ your friends are hyped.
- But when you try to actually ship? Everything breaks.

Here's what AI builders run into over and over again:
### Vercel â†’ Frontend only
Great for Next.js, but backends choke. Cold starts, DB caps, and flaky APIs make anything beyond a demo collapse.
### Render/Fly/Railway â†’ Lock-in city
Easy launch, painful scale. CLIs, YAML drama, 30â€“50s cold starts, and platform quirks that kill portability.
### AWS/GCP/Azure â†’ Complexity infra tax hell
Hundreds of overlapping services = analysis paralysis. IAM, VPC, pricing hellâ€”mental load becomes the real security risk.
### Lovable/Bolt â†’ Just for Demos and MVPs
Fun prototypes, but broken in prod: public DBs, missing row-level security, spoofable payments. Demo â‰  product.

ðŸ‘‰ **Your demo stays in localhost. Your product never sees real users.**

## A Quick Look Back: Why the Cloud Exists
- **Cloud 1.0 (AWS era):** Elastic compute, storage, and networking. Freedom from servers â€” but youâ€™re still stuck assembling primitives.  
- **Cloud 2.0 (PaaS era):** Git push â†’ URL. Heroku, Vercel, Netlify. Magical for narrow workloads, but you quickly hit walls.  
- **Cloud 3.0 (Nexlayer era):** The cloud becomes machine-readable. MCP gives agents and tools a universal way to deploy apps directly to production.  

> The Cloud freed us from servers, but not from the complexity of turning code into production. The Nexlayer MCP (model context protocol) closes that gap.   

---
## What Ifâ€¦
What if you could transform your MVP into a production-grade app that scales â€” in just one prompt? With Nexlayer, you can. Ask your agent: *"Deploy my GitHub repo {url} to Nexlayer."*
Behind the scenes, Nexlayer automatically:
- Clones the repo
- Detects the stack
- Builds & containerizes your app
- Injects env vars & secrets
- Writes the Launchfile
- Audits, validates, and tests
- Deploys to production infra
- Returns: logs, telemetry, and a live URL

All in **under 5 minutes.**
That's **Prompt â†’ Production â†’ URL.**

## Let's Ship Your First App with the Nexlayer MCP:

### 1. Generate a token
Visit the [Nexlayer MCP install page](https://app.nexlayer.io) and grab your API token.

### 2. Set up your coding agent with Nexlayer-MCP
(Example: Cursor â€” add the config below to `.cursor/mcp.json`)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nexlayer_mcp": {
      "url": "https://mcp.nexlayer.ai/api/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <NEXLAYER_MCP_TOKEN>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note:** If you ever get stuck, your agent can help configure MCP for you.

### 3. Deploy your GitHub repo
Once MCP is installed, just tell your agent:

```bash
Deploy my project https://github.com/username/repo to Nexlayer
```

Your agent handles the rest. Minutes later: a production-ready app, live on Nexlayer.

ðŸ‘‰ One prompt. One deploy. One live URL.

## Why This Matters for AI Builders

The future of software is AI-native. But without deployment, AI's potential stalls at the demo stage.

Nexlayer eliminates the bottleneck â€” so you can focus on building, not babysitting infra.

**From prompt to production in minutes, not weeks or months.** That's the promise of the AI-native cloud.
