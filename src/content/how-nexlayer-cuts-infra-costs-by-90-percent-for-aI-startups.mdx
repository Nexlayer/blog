AI startups are burning through infrastructure budgets faster than ever. Nexlayer's intelligent optimization cuts costs by up to 90% while improving performance.

## The Cost Crisis

Traditional cloud platforms charge for:

- **Over-provisioned resources** that sit idle
- **Always-on infrastructure** even during low usage
- **Manual scaling** that reacts too slowly
- **Separate services** for CDN, databases, and compute

## Nexlayer's Cost Optimization

- **Intelligent Scaling**: Scale to zero during idle periods
- **Edge Computing**: Serve content from the nearest location
- **Resource Sharing**: Efficient multi-tenant architecture
