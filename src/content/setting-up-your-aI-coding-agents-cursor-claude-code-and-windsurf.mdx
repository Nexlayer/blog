Getting your AI coding tools connected to Nexlayer takes less than 5 minutes. Here's how to set up each major platform.

## Cursor Integration

Install the Nexlayer MCP server:

```bash
Install via Cursor's MCP manager
cursor mcp install nexlayer

Or manually add to your MCP config:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nexlayer": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@nexlayer/mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Claude Integration

Add Nexlayer to your Claude desktop app:

1. Open Claude Settings → MCP Servers
2. Add server: \`@nexlayer/mcp-server\`
3. Restart Claude

Now you can deploy directly from conversations:
"Deploy this React app to production" → Live URL in 60 seconds

## Windsurf Setup

Windsurf includes Nexlayer integration by default:

- Generate code with Windsurf
- Click "Deploy to Nexlayer"
- Get instant live URL

## Universal CLI

For any environment:

<BlogCodeBlock language="bash">
  npm install -g @nexlayer/cli nexlayer login nexlayer deploy
</BlogCodeBlock>

## Pro Tips

- **Auto-deploy**: Enable automatic deployment on file save
- **Preview URLs**: Get unique URLs for every code iteration
- **Team Sharing**: Share live previews instantly with stakeholders
- **Custom Domains**: Connect your own domain in one click

Your AI agents are now ready to ship production applications instantly.
