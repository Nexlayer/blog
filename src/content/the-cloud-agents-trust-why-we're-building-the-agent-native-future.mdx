## Why Nexlayer Exists, What Pain It Kills

AI can already write code. But for most builders, that’s where the magic stops.  
Your repo sits in GitHub, your demo runs locally, but production always feels out of reach.  

With Nexlayer, the loop is finally simple:  

**Prompt → Production → URL.**  

Install MCP, tell your agent to deploy, and minutes later your app is live on Nexlayer.  
No dashboards. No DevOps. No friction. Just you, your code, and a live link you can share.

## The Pain You Feel Every Day

- You vibe-code an MVP in Cursor or Claude Code → it works great in a demo.  
- You share screenshots and videos on X or Discord → your friends are hyped.  
- But when you try to actually ship? Everything breaks.  

Here’s what builders hit over and over again:

- **Vercel → “Frontend only”**  
  Great for Next.js, but backends choke. Cold starts, DB caps, and flaky APIs make anything beyond a demo collapse.  

- **Render/Fly/Railway → “Lock-in city”**  
  Easy launch, painful scale. CLIs, YAML drama, 30–50s cold starts, and platform quirks that kill portability.  

- **AWS/GCP/Azure → “Complexity tax”**  
  Hundreds of overlapping services = analysis paralysis. IAM, VPC, pricing hell—mental load becomes the real security risk.  

- **Lovable/Bolt → “Just for demos”**  
  Fun prototypes, but broken in prod: public DBs, missing row-level security, spoofable payments. Demo ≠ product.  

👉 Your demo stays in localhost. Your product never sees real users.

## What If…

What if you could transform your MVP into a production-grade app that scales — in just one prompt?  

With Nexlayer, you can. Ask your agent: *“Deploy my repo to Nexlayer.”*  

Behind the scenes, Nexlayer automatically:  
- Clones the repo  
- Detects the stack  
- Builds & containerizes your app  
- Injects env vars & secrets  
- Writes the Launchfile  
- Audits, validates, and tests  
- Deploys to production infra  
- Returns: logs, telemetry, and a live URL  

All in **under 5 minutes.**  
That’s **Prompt → Production → URL.**

## Walkthrough: Ship Your First Repo with MCP

1. **Generate a token**  
   Visit the [Nexlayer MCP install page](https://app.nexlayer.com) and grab your API token.  

2. **Set up your coding agent with Nexlayer-MCP**  
   (Example: Cursor — add the config below to `.cursor/mcp.json`)  

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "nexlayer_mcp": {
         "url": "https://mcp.nexlayer.ai/api/mcp",
         "headers": {
           "Authorization": "Bearer <NEXLAYER_MCP_TOKEN>"
         }
       }
     }
   }

Note: If you ever get stuck, your agent can help configure MCP for you.

3. Deploy your GitHub repo
Once MCP is installed, just tell your agent:

```bash
Deploy my project https://github.com/username/repo to Nexlayer
```


Get a live URL
In under 5 minutes, your app is online.

👉 One prompt. One deploy. One live URL.

Ship faster → stop wasting weeks wrestling with infra.

Own your feedback loop → test with real users immediately.

Level up → go from localhost → production without needing a senior DevOps engineer.

Focus on building → let Nexlayer handle containers, scaling, and security.
