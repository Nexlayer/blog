AI agents are reshaping how software gets built. But existing cloud platforms weren't designed for this new paradigm.

## The Trust Gap

When AI agents generate code, they need infrastructure that understands their output patterns. Traditional platforms require manual configuration, YAML files, and DevOps expertise that agents don't possess.

## Agent-Native Design Principles

Nexlayer was built with four core principles for AI-generated applications:

- **Instant Recognition**: Automatically detect app frameworks and dependencies
- **Zero Configuration**: No YAML, no setup files, no manual intervention
- **Intelligent Scaling**: Predict usage patterns from code structure
- **Security by Default**: Built-in protection for AI-generated vulnerabilities

## Real-World Impact

Since launch, we've deployed over 50,000 AI-generated applications. From simple landing pages to complex SaaS platforms, agents trust Nexlayer to handle the infrastructure complexity.

The cloud agents trust isn't just a tagline - it's our commitment to being the infrastructure layer that AI agents can rely on completely.
