YAML configuration files are a relic of the pre-AI era. When agents generate applications, they shouldn't need to understand Docker, Kubernetes, or deployment pipelines.

## The Configuration Problem

Traditional platforms require:

- Dockerfile configuration
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Environment variable management
- Resource allocation decisions
- Scaling configuration

AI agents excel at generating application logic, but struggle with infrastructure configuration that requires deep DevOps knowledge.

## Nexlayer's Solution

Our platform uses intelligent code analysis to automatically:

- **Detect Framework**: React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, or vanilla HTML
- **Identify Dependencies**: Package.json analysis and optimization
- **Configure Resources**: CPU, memory, and storage based on app complexity
- **Set Up Networking**: SSL, CDN, and global distribution
- **Enable Monitoring**: Performance tracking and error reporting

## Real-World Results

Since eliminating configuration files:

- **95% faster** time to deployment
- **Zero configuration errors** from AI agents
- **100% success rate** for supported frameworks
- **90% cost reduction** through intelligent resource allocation

One file in, live application out. That's the Nexlayer promise.
