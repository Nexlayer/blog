## From Repo to Production in Minutes

Deploying an AI-built application should be as fast as building one. That's why we built the **Nexlayer MCP** â€” a new way to go from GitHub repo to live production URL directly from your code editor.

With MCP, your AI agent or IDE can talk directly to Nexlayer. That means you can write code in Cursor, Claude, or VS Code and ship it straight to production without leaving your editor.

## How the Nexlayer MCP Works

When you connect your editor with MCP, Nexlayer handles the heavy lifting automatically:

1. **Clone your repo**
2. **Detect the language, framework, and environment**
3. **Generate a production-grade Dockerfile**
4. **Build and push the image to a secure registry**
5. **Write a nexlayer.yaml launchfile with service config**
6. **Deploy to Nexlayer's global container infrastructure**
7. **Return a live production URL instantly**

Your first deployment is free for 30 minutes. You can extend it to 2 hours, redeploy again to continue testing, or reserve it to scale. You can also add a custom domain to make production-ready demos instantly accessible to users, investors, or teammates.

## Two Paths to Deployment

Not every builder works the same way. Nexlayer gives you two ways to ship:

### 1. AI Agent Path (Recommended)

After you've [installed](https://app.nexlayer.io/) the Nexlayer-MCP Just tell your agent or editor:

```
Deploy my app to Nexlayer.
@https://github.com/your-repo
```

Nexlayer deploys your repo to cloud production-ready environment that scales in minutes. Perfect for indie builders and startup founders who want speed without infra headaches.

### 2. Manual Launchfile Path

For teams that need more control, you can write your own launchfile `nexlayer.yaml`.

This gives you full access to service definitions, environment variables, scaling options, and advanced configs â€” while still deploying to the same global infra.

Think of the launchfile as your infrastructure contract. It's portable, editable, and production-ready.

## Why This Matters

In the age of AI, building an app takes minutes, but deploying it to production often takes weeks or even months of complex cloud engineering and DevOps setup. Nexlayer closes that gap.

- **Indie builders** can launch projects without hitting infra walls
- **Founders** can turn MVPs into real products quickly  
- **Enterprises** can move past POCs and launch production AI apps

MCP makes deployment invisible. The launchfile gives you control when you need it. Together, they make Nexlayer the first agent-native cloud.
