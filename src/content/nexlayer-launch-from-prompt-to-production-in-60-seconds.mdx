Today marks a pivotal moment in software deployment. Nexlayer launches as the first truly AI-native cloud platform, designed from the ground up for the age of AI-generated code.

## The Agent-Native Revolution

Traditional cloud platforms were built for human developers writing code line by line. But AI agents work differently. They generate complete applications, iterate rapidly, and need infrastructure that can keep pace with their speed.

Nexlayer bridges this gap by providing instant deployment from any AI coding tool - whether you're using Cursor, Claude, or Windsurf. No configuration files, no DevOps knowledge required.

## Zero-Setup Architecture

Our platform automatically detects your application type, provisions the right resources, and deploys to a global CDN in under 60 seconds:

```bash
Deploy from any AI tool
nexlayer deploy
Or use our MCP integration
Works automatically with Cursor, Claude, Windsurf
```

The future of software is AI-generated, and the infrastructure should be just as intelligent. Welcome to the agent-native cloud.
